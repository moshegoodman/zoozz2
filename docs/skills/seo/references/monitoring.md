# Measurement and Monitoring

Bind each metric to the actual property, hostname and project path. Verify native report access, analytics filters and conversion-event meaning before interpreting a trend.

## Separate the measurements

| Question | Evidence | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| Are pages indexed and receiving search traffic? | Native Google/Bing indexing and performance reports | Ownership verification or sitemap submission alone proves neither |
| Is the site visible in Google's generative AI features? | Search Console generative AI performance, including available impression/page/country/device/date dimensions | Verify current report access and supported dimensions; do not invent AI-specific clicks or CTR from impression-only data. Read it as presence, not position: an AI answer is not a ranked list, so average position and CTR there do not mean what they mean for links |
| Is Bing/Copilot citing it? | Bing Webmaster AI Performance, available citations, cited pages and grounding-query/topic dimensions | Needs Bing Webmaster verification first, otherwise `No data`; availability and sampling vary; citation counts are not ranking positions or referral visits |
| Is a tracked prompt producing mentions/citations? | Repeated, documented engine-specific prompt panel or connected visibility tool | Preserve prompts, engine/model, search mode, locale, date, repetitions, sample size and citation URL; a panel is not population-wide demand. Report a rate per engine, never one blended score or a ranking position |
| How often do people ask the topic? | Vendor Exact prompt demand metric | Demand is not the site's share of visibility |
| Is AI influence arriving without a referral? | Branded search impressions, direct sessions in the campaign window, and a self-reported "how did you hear" answer | Leading indicators, not proof of AI attribution; keep each as its own series |
| Does discovery produce useful outcomes? | Analytics landing sessions, qualified visits, signups, activation or revenue | Preserve attribution definitions and windows; missing/referrer-stripped visits prevent complete AI attribution |
| Do the agent-readable surfaces answer? | Scanner scorecards and `agent-ready`'s `check-surfaces.sh` output | Says whether `llms.txt`, markdown twins and headers work, not whether any engine cites them; agent readership itself needs server logs, and without a log drain it is `No data` |

Inspect current native capabilities using `sources.md`, not a frozen vendor checklist. Google generative AI reports may expose different dimensions for Search and Discover. Where a connector omits a native report, use an available browser/export or report that gap rather than silently substituting overall search data.

## Prompt panels

A single prompt run is a sample of one: answers and cited sources change between identical runs and from week to week. Treat each prompt as a survey question.

- Run each prompt several times (three to five) in clean sessions and report mention and citation rates with the run count, not a point estimate.
- Keep each engine, and Google AI Overviews versus AI Mode, on its own line; engines retrieve from different indexes and cite different source types.
- Use real buyer questions with the persona and use case, plus at least one follow-up turn where alternatives or price are asked.
- Store the raw answer with cited URLs, engine, model, mode, locale, timestamp and collection method. Never mix collection methods (API, SERP provider, browser) in one trend line, and never infer a citation without a URL.
- Classify cited sources by type (see `answer-engines.md`) and record the attributes the answer associates with the brand; those are what content can change.
- Record recall without retrieval separately from citations. They measure different things and are never summed.

Third-party rank and AI-visibility tools that scrape results can lose collection without notice. Check the vendor's collection status before trending its data, and prefer native reports.

## Diagnose a change

Use complete, comparable windows with matching filters, data freshness and aggregation. Check reporting lag, weekdays/seasonality, campaigns, releases, migrations and tracking changes before attributing movement to ranking. Segment by brand/non-brand, page group, country, device and search appearance where supported and relevant. Do not average positions across incompatible populations.

Report absolute counts alongside percentage changes. Moving from 5 clicks to 4 is a one-click change, not sufficient evidence of a material incident by itself. Set alert thresholds from baseline volume, normal variance, persistence and business impact; no universal 20% threshold. For sparse data, extend the observation window or report uncertainty rather than inventing significance.

Distinguish loss of visibility, lower click-through, fewer sessions and weaker activation. Verify conversion instrumentation before concluding that SEO traffic quality changed. If authentic scope or outcome data is absent, mark it `No data` and name the smallest next check.

## Recurring checks

Use an existing matching owner/schedule when recurring work is authorized. A proposed cadence is not a configured monitor. Preserve the configured destination and notification preferences; do not send an unapproved recap elsewhere.

- Anomaly checks report new, material changes supported by the baseline, plus actionable access or delivery failures.
- Digests summarize completed comparable periods, leading page/query movements, engine-specific AI visibility, conversion outcomes and the next decision.
- Deduplicate previously reported incidents. An unchanged refresh does not need another notification.
- Repeated authentication failures should be surfaced through the host's supported reauthentication flow rather than retried indefinitely.

Keep monitoring reads separate from mutations. Store durable reports and alert state in the mapped project system, not inside the installed skill folder.
